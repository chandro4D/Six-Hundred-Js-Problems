// practice problem 1:
/* "ANS: SyntaxError"*/

// practice problem 2:
/* "Reference Error Occurs When we use a variable which is uninitialized " */

// practice problem 3:
/* When we write wrong syntax code like missing bracket or semiclone
then we face Syntax error problem..And Type error occurs when we use
one operation which is not for that types of data.*/
