// practice problem 1:

    /*
        Strict mode in JavaScript is used to make the code more secure and easier to debug. 
        It helps catch common coding mistakes, such as using undeclared variables. 
        It also prevents the use of certain unsafe features, like deleting variables or 
        using reserved keywords. By enabling strict mode, developers can write cleaner, 
        more reliable and maintainable code.
