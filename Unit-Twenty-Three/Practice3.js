// practice problem 1:
  /*
    With is a javascript statement which is used for set javascript scope willingly.
    It is not recommended to use it in modern javascript because it makes code hard to
    read and debug.
  */

// practice problem 2:
  /*
    In JavaScript, eval() executes a string as JavaScript code. It is not recommended 
    because it poses serious security risks, allowing attackers to run harmful code if 
    user input is passed. It also slows performance since it forces the interpreter to 
    re-parse code at runtime. Instead, safer alternatives like functions or `JSON.parse()` 
    should be used.
