// practice problem 1:
        /*
            In a browser, the  window object is a special object that contains global variables,
            functions and properties. Wherever  javascript runs, there must be a global object or
            window object.

// practice problem 2 :
       /*
            In a browser, when we console.log(this) or run this, the value of this will be a
            window or global object.
