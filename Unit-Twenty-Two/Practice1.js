// practice problem 1:
        /*
            In a browser, the  window object is a special object that contains global variables,
            functions and properties. Wherever  javascript runs, there must be a global object or
            window object.

// practice problem 2 :
       /*
            In a browser, when we console.log(this) or run this, the value of this will be a
            window or global object.

// practice problem 3 :
       /*
            when we use this inside of a normal object method function, then that
            this will refer to that object but when we declare this inside of an arrow
            function it will refer to the window or global object.
