// practice problem 1:

  /*
       In JavaScript, an execution context is the environment in which a piece of code is evaluated and 
       executed. It contains information like variables, functions, scope chain, and the value of `this`. 
       JavaScript creates a global execution context first, and then function execution contexts whenever 
       a function is called. It works this way to manage how code is executed, ensuring proper access to 
       variables and functions through scoping and the call stack.
  */



       
// practice problem 2:

    /*
        The global execution context is the default environment created when JavaScript code starts running. 
        It defines the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js) and sets `this` to that 
        object. All global variables and functions are stored here, making them accessible throughout the 
        program. It is needed because it provides the foundation for code execution and acts as the 
        starting point for all other execution contexts.
