// practice problem 1:
    /*JavaScript code run on the browser with the help of V8 Engine.At first V8 Engine parse Js code,
       then Interpreter read the code,after that JIT(Just In Time) came and then some
       parts of code transformed into Machine code which run code first and give the output */

// practice problem 2:
    /* JavaScript is a high level programming Language.*/

// practice problem 3:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log("The Sum Is:",add(22, 5)); 

// practice problem 4:
                           /*memory management*/
  /*In JavaScript, memory management is automatic, meaning the engine allocates 
    memory when variables, objects, or functions are created. As the program runs, 
    this memory is used to store data and perform operations. Developers donâ€™t need to 
    manually allocate or free memory, as JavaScript handles this process internally.

                            /*Garbage collection*/
  /*Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing memory that is no longer 
    in use. The most common method is the mark-and-sweep algorithm, which removes values 
    that are no longer reachable in the code. When there are no references to an object, 
    the garbage collector clears it to reclaim memory. This helps prevent memory leaks 
    and keeps the application efficient.
