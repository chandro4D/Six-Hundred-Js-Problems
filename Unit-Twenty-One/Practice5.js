        In JavaScript, inheritance works through prototypes. Every object can inherit 
        properties and methods from another object using the prototype chain.

        Prototypical inheritance in JavaScript is a feature where objects inherit 
        properties and methods from other objects through a prototype chain. Instead 
        of classes, JavaScript uses prototypes, allowing one object to serve as a template 
        for another.
