// practice problem 1:
    /*
        Inheritance in js is a feature that allows one class (Child class) to use properties
        and methods of another class(Parent Class). We need inheritance to follow the DRY 
        (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and make code easier to manage and scale.
    */

// practice problem 2:
    /*
        In JavaScript, use the `extends` keyword to make a child class inherit 
        from a parent class, and use `super()` inside the child constructor to 
        call the parent's constructor.
