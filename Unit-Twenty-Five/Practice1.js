// practice problem 1:
   /*
       JavaScript code runs in the browser using javaScript engine(V8),that interprets and executes the code.
       At first the engine parsing the code and then it compiles the code to machine code and 
       finally it executes the code.
   */

// practice problem 2:
    /*
        The V8 engine is Googleâ€™s open-source JavaScript engine used in Chrome and Node.js. It compiles 
        JavaScript code directly into machine code for faster execution. It also manages memory and optimizes 
        performance during runtime. This makes JavaScript applications run efficiently and quickly.

    */

// practice problem 3:
    /*
        A JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler improves JavaScript performance by compiling code at runtime instead of 
        before execution. It first interprets the code then identifies frequently used parts and compiles them 
        into machine code for faster execution. This process combines the speed of compiled code with the 
        flexibility of interpreted code. As a result programs run more efficiently.
